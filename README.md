## Projects

### [NBA Data Analysis](https://github.com/victorleaoo/NBA-Data-Science-Project)
  In this project, I was able to practice my data analysis abilities, using **Python Packages** related to **Data Manipulation** and **Data Visualization**, such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**.

  It was very fun to analyze and understand various datasets related to the National Basketball Association (NBA). I could find a lot of interesting patterns and informations while studying and exercising importants concepts.

### [University of Brasilia Assignments and Works](https://github.com/victorleaoo/UnB-Software)
  In this repository, I summarized all my **assignments** and **works** done throughout my **Software Engineering Degree** path.

### [Spotify Playlists Stats](https://github.com/victorleaoo/Spotify-Playlists-WebApp)
  This was my first **full-stack project**, in which I used **React (JS)** to design the front-end and **FastAPI** + **Python** to make calls to the **Spotify API**, manipulate the data I got and present it to the user.

  I felt very realized that I was able to do a simple, but interesting project like this, since listening and searching about music is one of my biggests hobbies.
